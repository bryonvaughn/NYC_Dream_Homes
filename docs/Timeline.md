## Team Structure and Timeline

### Project Work Plan

In order to deliver a suitable solution for Dream Homes NYC, our team will separate work tasks into technical and functional phases assigning responsibilities to individuals or groups depending on the nature of the work.

The following are major deliverables in our development cycle, along with the team member(s) responsible for each:

#### Documenting Business Requirements

Before work can begin, we need a clear understanding of the technical and functional requirements from the client. The entire team will need to work on this, and the output should be a clearly documented set of requirements to drive the next phases of the project.

#### Schema Design

As the building blocks for the overall solution, the schema design phase is critical to our success. Two individuals will be responsible for the schema design, including both ER diagrams and SQL code.

| Owners             | Rachel & Valerie                     |

#### Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL)

When the database schema is complete, it is essential for the team to provide a plan and tools for importing client data into the database. One team member will be responsible for defining the initial set of data that will be used to validate the structure and to build and test functionality in the latter stages of the project. In addition to defining the data, the team member will provide a process and subsequent scripts to load the data into the database.

#### User Experience (UX)

The final component of our solution is how our clients will use the database to drive their business. We will provide a set of examples for using the new data store to improve their business processes through SQL queries, reports, and dashboards.
