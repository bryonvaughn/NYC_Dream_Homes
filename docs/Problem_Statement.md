## Problem Statement

The team has been provided the following project scope statement:

> Dream Homes NYC is a real estate agency servicing the Tri-State area (NY, NJ, CT), with multiple office locations in each state. They connect home sellers with potential buyers and home owners with potential renters. In other words, Dream Homes NYC clients can buy, rent, or sell homes (note: homes means single houses, townhouses, apartments, etc). The company employs both full-time and part-time agents. Dream Homes NYC wants to modernize their systems and build a database that will help them both organize their corporate data (offices, employees, expenses, profits, etc) and more importantly save all information on homes, clients, transactions, open houses, appointments, and anything else that can make them more efficient while improving the client experience.  Your team is hired to develop this new system. Dream Homes NYC leadership is even thinking about using the database to drive insights and perhaps build an app in the future.

Given the clientâ€™s initial direction, and a deep dive into the existing business processes, we will design a solution focused on the following set of business requirements:

### Non-Functional Requirements

Other than ensuring a scalable data solution, the following technical requirements are not within the initial scope of the database design project. This does not mean they are not important, and should be considered essential for the final go live scenario, especially before replacing existing systems and business processes.

  - ***Performance***
    - *Scalability*
      - Ensure the database can scale to accommodate the growing data from multiple office locations and increasing number of transactions.
