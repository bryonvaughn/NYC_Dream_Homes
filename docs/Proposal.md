## Proposal

For the Dream Homes NYC project, we are dedicated to creating a comprehensive database system that enhances agency operations and client services, focusing on the two main real estate transaction branches: rental and purchase. This dual-focus approach is designed to streamline operations, provide targeted services, and improve data management.

### Proposed Solution

Here is an overview of the key tables that will be established and their functional purposes:

#### Core Tables

- **Offices**
  - Information on each office location, including addresses, contact details, and managers.
- **Employees**
  - Data on all agency employees, detailing their roles, assignments, and employment status (full-time or part-time).
- **Properties**
  - Records details of all properties managed by the agency, including location, price, type, and current status (available, sold, rented).
- **Clients**
  - Comprehensive information about clients.
- **Transactions**
  - Documentation of all transactions, categorized as rentals or purchases, detailing properties, clients, and involved agents.
- **Events**
  - Management of data related to events like open houses and client appointments, linked to relevant properties and staff.

#### Supporting Tables

- **Addresses**
  - Geographic information crucial for targeted marketing and operations in both rental and purchase segments.
- **Property Types**
  - Classification of properties into categories like apartments, townhouses, or single-family houses to streamline searches.
- **Agents**
  - Different roles within the agency to delineate responsibilities in handling rentals versus purchases.
- **Transaction Types**
  - Differentiation of transaction types, such as leases and sales, for accurate reporting and compliance.
- **Business Expenses**
  - Tracking of business expenses for profit and loss reporting.

### Objectives

This structured system will boost operational efficiency and strategic decision-making, providing a detailed view of the agency's rental and purchase activities. By focusing on these branches, the database addresses unique challenges and opportunities in each area, ensuring tailored client services and optimized performance.
